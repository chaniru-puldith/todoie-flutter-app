# todoie

A simple Flutter project for to-do app.

## Getting Started

Todoie is a Flutter app that helps users maintain their to-do list. It has three main functions: adding tasks, checking completed tasks, and deleting tasks. The app uses the provider package to manage the to-do list data, which makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

To add a task, users simply tap on the "+" button and enter the task name. The task is then added to the list. Users can check completed tasks by tapping on the checkbox next to the task name. The task is then crossed out to indicate that it is completed. To delete a task, users swipe the task to the left. A delete button will appear, which the user can tap to delete the task.

Todoie is a simple and easy-to-use app that can help users stay organized and on top of their tasks. It is perfect for anyone who needs a simple way to manage their to-do list.
